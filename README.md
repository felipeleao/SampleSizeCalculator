Sample Size Calculator
====================

A simple implementation of a probabilistic approach to determine the sample size needed when conducting surveys. The user must have in mind that stratas should be defined prior determining the size of the sample.

The project have only two classes:

 - `SampleSizeCalculator.java` - exposes the methods to actually determine the sample size;
 - `Main.java` - a simple example of how the calculator class can be used.
